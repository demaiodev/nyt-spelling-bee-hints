# Hintify

 A small plugin for the New York Times game, Spelling Bee. Often times, you get 3/4 of the way through the list of words and find yourself stumped.
 This plugin is aimed to assist you in solving more of the puzzle by providing easier access to the already available hints. 
 
 Instead of opening the hints URL in a separate tab and flipping back and forth, this injects the hints straight into the spelling bee's document.
