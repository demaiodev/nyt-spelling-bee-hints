# Spelling Bee Hintify

A small plugin for the New York Times game, Spelling Bee. Often times, you get 3/4 of the way through the list of words and find yourself stumped.

Instead of opening the hints URL in a separate tab and flipping back and forth, this injects the hints straight into the spelling bee's document.

Since I don't want to spend $5 to get a Chrome developer's account, you'll have to load this extension manually. Sorry.

1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2. Expand the Developer dropdown menu and click “Load Unpacked Extension”
3. Navigate to the local folder containing this code and click "Ok"
